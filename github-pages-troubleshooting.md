# GitHub Pages 404 Troubleshooting Guide

If you're experiencing a 404 error when trying to access your GitHub Pages site at `https://amelling.github.io/gif-spinner/`, here are several steps to diagnose and fix the issue:

## 1. Check GitHub Pages Settings

First, verify your GitHub Pages settings:

1. Go to your GitHub repository (`https://github.com/amelling/gif-spinner`)
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Scroll down to the "Pages" section in the sidebar
4. Check that:
   - Source is set to "GitHub Actions" (or "Deploy from a branch" if you're using that method)
   - If using branch deployment, ensure it's set to the correct branch (usually `main` or `gh-pages`)
   - Confirm that the site is listed as "Your site is published at `https://amelling.github.io/gif-spinner/`"

## 2. Verify Workflow Deployment Success

Check if your GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully:

1. Go to your repository
2. Click the "Actions" tab
3. Look for the most recent workflow run
4. If it shows a red ❌, the deployment failed:
   - Click on the failed run
   - Review the error logs
   - Fix any issues in your workflow file or repository
   - Push changes to trigger a new deployment

## 3. Branch Name Issues

Ensure your repository is using the expected branch name:

1. GitHub Pages typically deploys from either `main`, `master`, or `gh-pages`
2. Check that your `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file specifies the correct branch names
3. Make sure your default branch matches what's specified in the workflow

## 4. Repository Name Verification

1. Confirm your repository name is exactly `gif-spinner` (case-sensitive)
2. If your repository has a different name, update the paths in your workflow or URLs accordingly

## 5. Check index.html Location

Ensure your `index.html` file is in the root of the deployed branch:

1. If using the GitHub Actions workflow we created, this should be handled automatically
2. If you modified the workflow, ensure it's deploying the files to the correct location

## 6. Wait for Propagation

Sometimes GitHub Pages needs time to update:

1. After a successful deployment, wait 5-10 minutes
2. Clear your browser cache and try again
3. Try accessing the site in an incognito/private window

## 7. Check for Custom Domain

1. Verify you haven't accidentally configured a custom domain in GitHub Pages settings
2. If you have, either set up DNS properly or remove the custom domain

## 8. Modify Workflow to Debug

Update your `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file to troubleshoot:

```yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Add a debug step to list files
      - name: Debug - List files
        run: ls -la
      
      # Add another debug step to show the GitHub Pages URL
      - name: Debug - Show GitHub Pages URL
        run: |
          echo "GitHub Pages URL: https://amelling.github.io/gif-spinner/"
          echo "Repository: ${{ github.repository }}"

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.4
        with:
          branch: gh-pages
          folder: .
```

## 9. Alternative Deployment Method

If GitHub Actions continues to fail, try the simpler branch-based deployment:

1. Go to Settings > Pages
2. Change Source from "GitHub Actions" to "Deploy from a branch"
3. Select "main" branch and "/" (root) directory
4. Click "Save"
5. Wait a few minutes for deployment
